The catalog of books is filled by the Administrator, adding and modifying / deleting them.

Each book should have: an address (shelf space) or a reader.

The reader to take the book is registered, leaving an e-mail and a phone number.

The book can be taken from the Administrator in the library for a period of not more than a month, only if
